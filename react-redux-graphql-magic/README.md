Deploy Your React Application While Saving Time and Energy

As a front end developer, we often dread the process of deploying and hosting our applications. We want to focus on perfecting the front end and hope the deployment process is quick and simple. Unfortunately, that’s usually not the case and we spend hours of our time and energy to do a simple deployment. I’ve created a React template application and quick start guide to help you save those wasted hours and make deploying your applications easier.

- Overview of template application
- React containers & components
- Redux actions, reducers and store

By the end of this talk, you’ll have a template and guide to deploy your React application while saving hours of your time and being stress free!
