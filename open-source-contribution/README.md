# How to make your first open source contribution in under 15 minutes

We’ve all heard of open source projects and that it’s important to contribute but what does that actually mean? When I first started off in my career, I kept hearing
"open source" from everyone all the time but I had no clue where to start. I felt confused and lost. I had numerous questions about what it was, the importance of contributing and how I could submit contributions to multiple projects. In this talk, I’ll share in detail on how you can start becoming a key contributor:

- What is open source?
- Why is it important?
- How do you find projects to contribute to?
- How do you contribute?
- Common pitfalls
- How to deal with getting discouraged
- Celebrate after each of your contributions!

I'll cover my experience T IBM and talk about some anecdotes I've heard from my friends who contribute to other open source projects. This talk will give you the necessary tools and resources to be able to make your first contribution in under 15 minutes!
