# Rescuing Legacy UIs: How IBM Is Putting Performance First

Imagine a codebase that loads Dojo, Polymer, jQuery, Angular, and React. Now imagine that you're responsible for making it fast. This is the situation Rizchel Dayao and her team were up against on the IBM Cloud console.

In this talk, Rizchel will share how her team has improved perceived performance by over 30⨉ in some cases, and brought actual load times down by as much as 250% — using GraphQL, Service Workers, resource preloading, and more — all while shifting the front-end culture at IBM toward performance.

- Get rid of the crap
- Use skeleton components instead of loading spinners
- Use GraphQL for data access
- Serve static assets
- Lazy load anything non-essential
- Use Service Workers
- Pay attention (webpack analyze)
- Measure (use performance marks)
